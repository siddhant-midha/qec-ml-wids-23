# Machine learning in quantum error correction

This project aims to investigate the use of machine learning techniques in the various steps of the quantum error correction pipeline.

# Plan

- Revise/study necessary background,
    - in machine learning, or
    - reinforcement learning
    - in quantum computing (circuits)
- Study the theory of quantum error correction
- Study the papers employing ML methods in QEC
- Implementation
