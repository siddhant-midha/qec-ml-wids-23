# Quantum Error Correction

The plan in this phase is to get everyone up to speed on the basic theory of QEC. Following are the suggested references,

1. Chapter 10 of _Quantum computation and quantum information_ by Nielsen and Chuang. Of course! How could we start without this book :) Do note that you need to develop a solid understanding of quantum operations and distance measures before diving into this chapter.
2. _Quantum Error Correction: An Introductory Guide_ by Joschka Roffe [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11157.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11157.pdf). This is written in a different, more pedagogical way, which can be refreshing! 
3. [Arthur Pesah's blogs on QEC](https://arthurpesah.me/blog/2022-01-25-intro-qec-1/). These blogs are an absolute asset, they provide nice intuitions, and I recommend going through them once.
4. [Stabilizer Codes and Quantum Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9705052.pdf): Daniel Gottesman's Ph.D. thesis. If you're doing QEC, you should know who Gottesman is!

Moreover, our aim in this phase is to understand the need for and the basic methods of quantum error correction. Particularly, we should emerge with a solid understanding of the Knill-Laflamme conditions and basics of stabilizer codes. Let's begin!
